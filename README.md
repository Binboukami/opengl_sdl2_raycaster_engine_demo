# opengl_sdl2-raycaster_engine
A raycaster engine demo using SDL2 and OpenGL context

__*Includes a pre-compiled build playable demo!__

The raycasting algorithm and code was made possible thanks to __3DSage__'s (youtube.com/user/artsage1) tutorials.

Futures implementations should define algorithm for array and map management systems.
